# Bamboo Sim

May 10 2025

3D visualization of agent based bamboo and diverse crop model growth.

Generally:

- shows visualization for farmers or other interested parties
- can simulate multiple years of growth and harvesting at several days a second
- 3d model of one or more hectares of bamboo and or other crops

- grows giant bamboo of up to 100 stalks per clump
- spaced out at about 7 meters per clump
- grows to maturity over five years (and is then harvested at 20%)
- grows on terrain that is currently generated using perlin noise

- runs in the browser
- uses orbital-sys module to manage agents
- uses orbital-volume to render a display
